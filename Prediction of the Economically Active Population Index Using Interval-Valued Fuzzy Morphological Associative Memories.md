**Abstract**: The last few decades have witnessed rapid progress in the field of type-2 fuzzy systems and in particular interval type-2 fuzzy systems. Encouraged by this progress, we present in this paper some theoretical foundations and applications of interval-valued fuzzy morphological
associative memories (IV-FMAMs) as a rule-based system. We perform simulations concerning the application of IV-FMAMs to the prediction of the monthly rate of participation of certain age groups in the work force of the metropolitan area of SËœao Paulo. The performance in terms
of mean squared prediction errors of the IV-FMAM approach is then compared with the one of a conventional type-2 fuzzy inference system.
