**Abstract**: The last decade has witnessed the emergence of a variety of lattice computing approaches towards computational intelligence such as morphological neural networks and fuzzy lattice reasoning / neuro-computing models. Here, the technical term “lattice"refers to a lattice in the mathematical sense of Birkhoff’s seminal work. Lattice theory grew out of Boolean algebra and has found a wide range of applications such as mathematical morphology, formal concept analysis, computational intelligence, and fuzzy set theory. Mathematical morphology on complete lattices represents the theoretical basis for a range of computational intelligence models known as morphological neural networks (MNNs) including gray-scale and fuzzy morphological associative memories (FMAMs). The advent of type-2 fuzzy systems suggests the development of type-2 FMAMs and in particular interval type-2 FMAMs or interval-valued FMAMs. Recall that the class of fuzzy sets as well as the classes of type-2, interval type-2, and interval-valued fuzzy sets over an arbitrary universe together with different choices of partial orderings form classes of L-fuzzy sets, where L denotes a complete lattice. In this master’s thesis, we introduce L-fuzzy morphological associative memories (L-FMAMs) on the basis of L-FMM. Our focus is on interval-valued FMAMs since interval type-2 fuzzy systems, have found various applications in engineering, computing with words, and approximate reasoning. We applied the aforementioned interval-valued FMAM models in conjunction with the interval-valued
fuzzy c-means clustering technique to a time-series prediction problem in industry, namely the problem of forecasting the average monthly streamflow of a hydroelectric plant located in southeastern Brazil, and compared the predictions produced by the IV-FMAM approach with the ones produced by a number of competitive models from the literature.
