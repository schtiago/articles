**Abstract**: The mathematical foundations of fuzzy morphological associative memories (FMAMs) can be found in mathematical morphology on complete lattices that include the class of fuzzy sets over a certain universe as a special case. The advent of type-2 fuzzy systems suggests the development of type-2 FMAMs and in particular interval-valued (type-2) FMAMs since the classes of general type-2 fuzzy sets and interval-valued fuzzy sets over a certain universe form complete lattices. For the sake of mathematical and computational simplicity, we employ representable conjunctions of interval-valued fuzzy set theory to define interval-valued FMAMs (IV-FMAMs) in this paper. Finally, we apply the resulting IV-FMAM models to a problem of monthly streamflow prediction of a large Brazilian hydro-electric plant.
